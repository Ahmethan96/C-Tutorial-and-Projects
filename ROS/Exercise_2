Let's put in practice all these data types we just learned!

In this exercise we are going to create a dictionary that will store the x position of the robot over time, and print it in the shell.

First, modify the program unit1_exercise.cpp of the previous exercise to get the x coordinate of the robot by calling the get_position() method, and also get the time of simulation by calling the get_time() method. Note that get_position() and get_time() are methods of the RosbotClass and you need to type rosbot.get_time() instead of just get_time() which is what you would write to call a regular function. (Hint: the timestamp will have a data type of double).

Then, make the robot move by calling the method move() which also belongs to the RosbotClass class.

Repeat step 1: take the x position and the timestamp.

Instead of printing them in the shell, you will initialize a dictionary and store the time obtained as a key, and the x position as a value. Do it for all the values you obtained of x, 1 time, 2 times, .. , as many as you want.

Print the dictionary with the code provided in the Dictionaries section.

Remember to compile and execute the file as explained in section 1.2.
- do the following before any changes.

cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
